### Description

This project is focusing on analyzing Instagram data to learn about the culture differences between different places. This project an- alyzes how filter usage are distributed in 50 cities, which are the cities with most population in each state of United States. This give us the information about how filter preference and vision culture varies in different states. The project also analyzes the number of hashtags been labeled on the posts for each city. It shows the popular hashtags for each city which reveal the popular event or hot terms in different cities. Our project also analyzes the Instagram filter data based on location and like to help you select better filters.

Interaction:

Location: user can click on dark blue dot, which is the city with largest population in a state. Then, the system shows the filter and tag visualization result based in the specific location. We want to use location as a filter for visualization results.

Filter: hovering on the chart shows filter visualization result. It lists the number of images using that filter and number of likes together with some sample images. This indicates the popularity of each filter.

Tags: clicking the city dot shows a words cloud with most popular tags shown up. This shows the average likes of photos using these tags.
